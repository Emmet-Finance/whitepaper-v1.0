# Operations and Roles

Emmet.Finance's token bridge involves various operations and roles contributing to its smooth functioning and efficient execution of cross-chain token transfers. This section provides an overview of the key operations and roles in the token bridge ecosystem.

## Token Bridge Operations:

### Token Deposits
Users initiate token transfers by depositing their tokens into the token bridge smart contracts on the source chain. This action marks the beginning of the token transfer process. Once the bridge contract receives the user tokens, it notifies the Relay-Validators utilizing the observer pattern.

### Signature Generation
Relay-Validators within the network collect the contract notifications and generate partial FROST signatures to endorse the off-chain transactions. These signatures are accumulated by the FROST round leader randomly chosen for each voting round. The transaction is considered valid once the threshold is reached and the signature aggregator submits it to the destination contract.

### Signature Validation
The Bridge Smart contracts deployed on each destination chain validate the FROST signatures generated by the Relay-Validators. This validation ensures the integrity and authenticity of the signatures before proceeding with token minting or release.

### Token Minting/Release
If the FROST signature is valid, the Bridge Smart contract on the destination chain mints or releases the tokens to the designated recipient's address, interacting with the token contract or the token liquidity pools, finalizing the cross-chain transfer and notifying the interested parties via an observer pattern.

### Fee payment
All the fees required by "Emmet.Bridge" are paid by the sender of the tokens on the chain of origin. Initially, the fees will be paid in the native coins of the chain of departure. Later, payments in Emmet.Finance's tokens will be implemented, giving a discount compared to payments in other currencies.

## Roles in the Token Bridge Ecosystem

### Users
Users are individuals or entities who initiate token transfers across different chains using the token bridge. They interact with the token bridge smart contracts by depositing tokens on the source chain and receiving tokens on the destination chain.

### Relay-Validators
Relay-Validators are network participants responsible for relaying transactions and validating transfers within the token bridge. They generate FROST signatures to authorize off-chain transactions and participate in the BFT consensus protocol to reach an agreement on transaction validity.

### Price-Oracles
Price-Oracles provide accurate and up-to-date token price data from external sources, such as CoinMarketCap and Binance. They play a crucial role in determining token prices required for cross-chain transfers and ensuring the accuracy of token conversions.

### Bridge Smart Contracts
Bridge Smart contracts are deployed on each chain within the token bridge ecosystem. They facilitate the validation of FROST signatures, enforce the authorization and integrity of token transfers, and handle the minting or release of tokens on the destination chain.

### Emmet.Team
Emmet.Team is responsible for further improving, adding functionality, freedom of decentralized integration, and development of the Emmet.Bridge.

### Emmet.DAO
The DAO is comprised of Emmet.Ecosystem members - token holders. Emmet.DAO members can propose and vote for or against the changes in the roadmap of the project and the further course of the project's development.

***

Each role within the token bridge ecosystem performs specific functions contributing to the seamless and secure execution of cross-chain token transfers. Users initiate transfers, Relay-Validators generate signatures, Price-Oracles provide token price data, Bridge Smart contracts validate signatures and facilitate token minting or release, and Administrators oversee the system's overall operations. By defining and allocating these roles, Emmet.Finance's token bridge establishes a well-organized and efficient ecosystem for cross-chain token transfers.
