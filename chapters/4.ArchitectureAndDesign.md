# Architecture and Design

Emmet.Finance's token bridge incorporates a comprehensive architecture and design that combines Relay-Validators, Price-Oracles, Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) consensus, and FROST signatures. This section provides an integrated overview of these components, outlining how they facilitate secure and efficient cross-chain token transfers.

## Relay-Validators
The token bridge utilizes a Relay-Validator network responsible for relaying transactions and validating transfers across blockchain networks. These Relay-Validators form a **distributed and decentralized network**, ensuring the integrity and security of the token transfer process. They participate in the **BFT consensus** protocol to agree on transaction validity, providing fault tolerance against potentially malicious behavior.

## BFT Consensus Mechanism
Within the network of Relay-Validators, the BFT consensus mechanism is employed to achieve agreement on the validity of transactions. By requiring $2/3+1$ relay-validator votes, the BFT consensus ensures that a **supermajority** of validators must agree before a transaction is considered valid. This consensus mechanism enhances the security and reliability of the token bridge by mitigating the impact of malicious nodes or attacks.

## Price-Oracles
Price-Oracles play a vital role in the token bridge's operation by providing token price data from trusted external sources, usually denominated in USDT equivalent. These Price-Oracles collect data from reputable APIs like CoinMarketCap, Binance, and others. The token bridge relies on Price-Oracles to determine the accurate token prices required for cross-chain transfers, enhancing the reliability and accuracy of the transfer process.

## FROST Signatures
FROST signatures are utilized within the token bridge to enable off-chain signing and validate signatures in the destination smart contracts. The Relay-Validators generate these signatures to endorse "foreign" chain transactions. FROST signatures provide a flexible and efficient approach to threshold signatures, ensuring the required relay-validator signatures are collected securely. This mechanism enables off-chain signing while preserving on-chain signature validation for transaction integrity.

## Secure Data Transmission
Security measures are implemented to secure data transmission between Price-Oracles, Relay-Validators, and the token bridge components. Encryption protocols, secure communication channels, and best practices in data handling are employed to protect sensitive information's integrity, confidentiality, and privacy. These security measures safeguard against unauthorized access and protect user data throughout the token transfer process.

## Robustness and Scalability
The combined architecture of Relay-Validators, BFT consensus, Price-Oracles, and FROST signatures enhances the token bridge's robustness, scalability, and security. Relay-Validators' decentralized nature and the BFT consensus mechanism provide resilience against malicious attacks and ensure reliable transaction validation. The number of validators is scalable to infinity without increasing the cost of the bridging transactions. Price-Oracles deliver accurate and up-to-date token price data, enabling precise cross-chain transfers. FROST signatures streamline off-chain signing and maintain on-chain signature validation, optimizing efficiency while preserving security.

Emmet.Finance's token bridge architecture and design integrate Relay-Validators, Price-Oracles, BFT consensus, and FROST signatures to create a robust, secure, and efficient solution for cross-chain token transfers. The combination of these components ensures consensus among Relay-Validators, accurate token pricing through Price-Oracles, secure off-chain signing with FROST signatures, and secure data transmission. This integrated architecture enables seamless and reliable token transfers, fostering interoperability and expanding possibilities within the decentralized finance ecosystem.
