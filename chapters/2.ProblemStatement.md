# Problem Statement

The blockchain ecosystem has witnessed remarkable growth, with numerous blockchain networks and cross-chain bridges emerging to cater to various use cases and requirements. However, this rapid proliferation of networks has only led to a fragmented landscape, resulting in significant challenges regarding token utility and accessibility on multiple chains. Here are several pain points that are yet to be addressed.

## Partial Token Coverage 
One of the major pain points is the limited token coverage provided by existing token bridges. Not all tokens can be bridged, creating a barrier for users transferring specific tokens across different blockchain networks. This limitation hampers the potential of decentralized finance (DeFi) and stifles the broader adoption of blockchain technology.

## Token Bridge Restrictions
In addition to partial token coverage, the current token bridge solutions often have restrictions on which tokens can be bridged to specific chains. It means certain tokens can only be bridged to a limited number of chains while remaining incompatible with others. This lack of universal compatibility introduces complexity and inefficiency, forcing users to navigate multiple bridges and networks to transfer their tokens.

## Failed Transactions and Unclaimed Tokens
Another pain point arises from the inherent risk of failed transactions during the token transfer process. Sometimes, bridge transactions fail to reach the intended destination address, resulting in lost or stuck tokens. In cases where the destination address needs to claim tokens, it may face challenges if it lacks the native coins required to execute the claim. This limitation creates a cumbersome process and potentially leads to unrecoverable tokens.

## Limited Transfer Amounts
Many existing token bridges impose minimum and maximum transfer limits, restricting users' freedom to transfer tokens according to their specific needs. These limitations hinder flexibility and large-scale transactions, limiting decentralized applications' potential growth and utility.

## Slow and Unreliable Transactions
The speed and reliability of token transfers through existing bridges are inconsistent and can take hours to days. Sometimes, transactions may even never arrive at the destination at all. This unpredictability and lack of timely transaction confirmation hinder the overall user experience and the seamless flow of tokens across blockchain networks.

## Lack of Transaction Visibility
Current token bridge solutions often lack a centralized platform or a unified place where users can easily track and monitor the progress of their transactions. This lack of transparency and visibility introduces uncertainty and frustration for users, as they cannot readily determine the status or outcome of their token transfers.

Addressing these pain points is crucial to foster a truly interconnected and efficient blockchain ecosystem. By overcoming these challenges, we can unlock the full potential of decentralized finance, enable seamless token transfers between different chains, and enhance the user experience for participants in the decentralized economy. Emmet.Finance aims to tackle these problems head-on by introducing a comprehensive and user-centric token bridge solution that addresses these pain points, revolutionizing cross-chain interoperability and empowering users in the decentralized finance landscape.
