# Introduction

## Definition

A fungible token bridge is a **protocol** allowing users or dApps to **transfer ownership** of an **arbitrary amount** of **native coins**, **stablecoins**, or custom **project tokens** from one **sovereign blockchain** to another.

## Classification

Existing bridges can be classified by functionality, direction, and centralization.

Division by functionality:

+ wrapper: locks the original token and mints a wrapped one
+ cross-chain-dex: accepts one token on chain A and releases another on chain B, converted according to the exchange rate

Division by transfer direction:

+ unidirectional: one-way bridges (A -> B)
+ bidirectional: two-way bridges (A <-> B)
+ multidirectional: A -> B -> C -> N -> A (Emmet.Bridge)

Division by centralisation:

+ custodial: centralized
+ non-custodial: decentralized (Emmet.Bridge)



The blockchain ecosystem has witnessed tremendous growth and innovation over the years, with multiple blockchain networks emerging to cater to various use cases and requirements. However, this proliferation of blockchain networks has resulted in a *fragmented landscape*, limiting the seamless transfer of assets and data between different protocols and the most important **dApps**, **DEXs**, and **CEXs**. This lack of interoperability has hindered the scalability and efficiency of decentralized applications, posing a significant challenge to the broader adoption of blockchain technology.

Emmet.Finance is an ambitious project that aims to address this challenge head-on by introducing a cutting-edge fungible token bridge. We aim to connect seamlessly **60 EVM** (Ethereum Virtual Machine compatible) chains and **40 Non-EVM** chains, enabling frictionless stablecoins and project tokens transfers across various blockchain protocols. By bridging these networks, we seek to create an interconnected blockchain ecosystem that unleashes the full potential of decentralized finance (DeFi) and unlocks new avenues for innovation and collaboration between chains, projects, and users.

The existing approaches to cross-chain interoperability often need to be revised to include limitations such as complexity, high fees, slow transaction speeds, and lack of trust. Emmet.Finance takes a comprehensive and user-centric approach to overcome these challenges and provide a robust solution for seamless cross-chain token transfers. Our token bridge leverages advanced technologies, secure smart contracts, consensus mechanisms, and decentralized oracles to ensure trustless and transparent transactions between blockchain networks and token standards.

The Emmet.Finance token bridge caters to **stablecoins**, **native coins**. It facilitates the transfer of **project tokens**, empowering developers and businesses to leverage various blockchain protocols' unique features and opportunities. With our bridge, users can easily move assets between EVM and Non-EVM chains, eliminating the barriers that have hindered interoperability in the past. It opens up a world of possibilities for decentralized exchanges, liquidity provision, cross-chain lending, asset management, and many other applications that span multiple blockchain networks.

Security, scalability, and user experience are at the core of Emmet.Finance's design principles. We have implemented stringent security measures and undergone thorough auditing processes to ensure the integrity and safety of transactions within our token bridge. By focusing on seamless integration and a user-friendly interface, we aim to make cross-chain transfers accessible to many users, fostering a more inclusive and efficient blockchain ecosystem.

In the following sections of this whitepaper, we will delve into the technical details of our token bridge, explaining its architecture, operation, and the benefits it offers to users and developers. We will also outline our roadmap, tokenomics, and governance structure, showcasing our commitment to long-term sustainability and community-driven growth.
Emmet.Finance invites you to join us on this transformative journey toward a truly interconnected and decentralized future of finance.

Together, we can overcome the barriers of blockchain fragmentation, unlock new opportunities, and empower a global ecosystem of innovation and collaboration.
